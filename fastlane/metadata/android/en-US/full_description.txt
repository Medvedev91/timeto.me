The main feature of this app is <u>goals</u>.

Tap a goal to start a timer with the remaining time for that goal.

Timer is running <u>all the time</u>, 24/7, even for sleep or breakfast. <u>No stop option!</u> To stop the current goal, you have to start the next one.

You can add a checklist for goals. Useful for morning/evening routines, work, exercises, etc.

This way I control my time and don't forget anything.

Try to adapt it to your life.
